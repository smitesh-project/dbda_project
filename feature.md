Based on moddel tarined by 3 algorithms namely Random-Forest,XGBoost and Random-Forestby PCA and domain knowledge we decided following features


Based on the features selected by both Random Forest and XGBoost, and considering domain knowledge related to flood prediction, here are the top 10 features for predicting flood probability:

Top 10 Features for Flood Probability:
IneffectiveDisasterPreparedness

Importance: Poor disaster preparedness can significantly impact flood severity and response, making this a crucial feature.
Siltation

Importance: Accumulation of silt can reduce the capacity of water bodies and increase flood risk.
CoastalVulnerability

Importance: Areas near coastlines are more prone to flooding due to storm surges and rising sea levels.
TopographyDrainage

Importance: The natural drainage of an area affects how water is absorbed or runs off, influencing flood risk.
Deforestation

Importance: Removal of vegetation can reduce the land's ability to absorb rainwater, increasing flood risk.
PoliticalFactors

Importance: Governance and policy decisions can impact infrastructure quality and flood management practices.
Encroachments

Importance: Building in flood-prone areas or on riverbanks can exacerbate flooding issues.
Urbanization

Importance: Increased impervious surfaces in urban areas can lead to higher runoff and increased flood risk.
ClimateChange

Importance: Climate change affects precipitation patterns and sea levels, influencing flood frequency and severity.
AgriculturalPractices

Importance: Certain farming practices can affect soil absorption and runoff, impacting flood risk
